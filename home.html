                    <div class="des">
                        From the 13th century, Sutherland was a provincial lordship, being an earldom controlled by the Earl of Sutherland. 
                        The earldom just covered the south-eastern part of the later county. A shire called Sutherland was created in 1633, 
                        covering the earldom of Sutherland and the neighbouring provinces of Assynt to the west and Strathnaver to the north. 
                        Shires gradually eclipsed the old provinces in administrative importance, and also become known as counties.

                    <div class="des">
                        Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years. 
                        The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of 
                        Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 
                        ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million).
